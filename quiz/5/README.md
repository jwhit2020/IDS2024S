1. Aesthetics in data visualization are map data values that are quantifiable features of results. A few examples are position, shape, size, color, line width, and line type.
2. They fall into two groups which are those that can represent continous data and those that cannot.
3. Difference between factor and levels are that factors can be ordered and levels are mostly without order.
4. The two major types of data are quantitative and qualitative. Example of quantitative is 1,2,3,4,5. Example of qualitative is colors blue, red, green, purple, pink.
5. Factors.
6. Example of ordered data are good, fair, poor. Example of unordered data are dog, cat, fish.
7. Periodic nature dataset.  
8. Qualitative color scale, is best used when to distinguish discrete items that don't have an intrinsic order like different countries on a map. Next, Color to represent data values, which can be used on wich values are larger or smaller than than which other ones. Next, diverging color scale, best used whne we need to visualize the deviation of data values in one of two directions relative to a neutral midpoint. Another one is, Color as a tool to highlight, it's best used to highlight specific elements in the data.
9. Because a 3D model pie chart could make pie slices in the front appear larger than they really are and pie slices in the back appear smaller. To where data won't be seen as accurately in a 3D model because of that reason.
10. An example could be 25 college students pick a number 1-5 and there are 5 sets of each number 1,2,3,4,5 and then we can categorzied these students into groups 1,2,3,4, and 5 depending on which number they picked  which would make data  categorical or just put the students in order 1 to 5 depednding on which number they picked making it numerical. Depending on how the data is represented could make data numerial or categorical.
11. Color are a categorical/unordered aesthetics.  
12. The one of the bottom left, the black colored with the labels e1 and e2.
13. The best one is the top one with the colors of red, light red, white, light green, dark green because these colors are warm to cool which us humans categorized them as.
14. Which city’s temperature is the least varying throughout the year? Chicago.
