1. cache memeory.  
2. The benefit of this hierarchical memory layout is that the CPU can predict and prefetch the future data or
   constructions from the slower but larger levels of memory hierarchy to the higher levels for subsequent usage by the CPU
   or computations.
3. The HHD device.
4. Registers, L1 cache, L2 cache, L3 cache, DRAM, Disk.
5. Bit.  
6. The advantage and simplicity of using binary 0 and 1 to
represent data may be obvious; 0 and 1 are easy to represent electronically. For example, the flow of the lack of flow of  
electric current could be used to represent 0 and 1. Alternatively, the presence or lack of a charge or magnetism in a  
particular location in the memory could be used to represent 0 and 1. Therefore, anything represented as a binary number  
can also be stored in computer memory and processed.

12. declarative knowledge involves statements of fact and  imperative knowledge is about how to accomplish something, or basically, is a recipe on how to do something, known as algorithm in scientific terminology.

28. A general method for solving a class of problems.  
29. S=1683. Every number increases by 3 in the order so you should add 3 plus every number beggining from 3 to 6 to 9 etc. s=3.
