1. The four major definitions of probaility are Classical Probability, Bayesian Probability, Frequentist Probability, and Propensity.    
2. Bayesian probaility.  
3. Bayesian probaility.  
4. Bayesian probaility.  
5. Frequentist: Rondald Fisher Bayesian: Harold Jeffreys.  
6. The range of a probaility value is either 0 or 1 or 1 + infinity. This is range is a convention of the definition of probability.    
7. I would trust the one with that says they see a donkey. I trust the one that s The probaility theory that sees the donkey because
   they are lookng out of a window and the animal is in a visual observation through a clear glass object they could make the animal seem
   small possibly. The thery that applies to this is frequentist. Since data is scarce and you only have a window to look through the animal
   could look small and seem to be a donkey to one person while it could look big and seem to be a horse to another. As no prior knowledge is given to fully see if it's a donkey or an horse.
#8-#11 are pictures.
