1. There is a set of properties that we desire to have in a theory of probability that we wish to 
construct now.Degrees of plausibility are represented by real numbers. Qualitative correspondence with common sense. Consistency.  
2. Bayesian probaility.  
3. Bayesian probaility.  
4. Bayesian probaility.  
5. Frequentist: Rondald Fisher Bayesian: Harold Jeffreys.  
6. The range of a probaility value is either 0 or 1 or 1 + infinity. This is range is a convention of the definition of probability.    
7. I would trust the one with that says they see a donkey. I trust the one that s The probaility theory that sees the donkey because
   they are lookng out of a window and the animal is in a visual observation through a clear glass object they could make the animal seem
   small possibly. The thery that applies to this is frequentist. Since data is scarce and you only have a window to look through the animal
   could look small and seem to be a donkey to one person while it could look big and seem to be a horse to another. As no prior knowledge
   is given to fully see if it's a donkey or an horse.
