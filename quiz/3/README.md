1. The steps in scientific interfernce we first do observational data (inverse problem),
   and then model construction, calibration and validation (forward problem), and finally predicition.
2. Three pillars of science is experiment, theory, and compuatation data.
3. Computation data brings a workflow by bridging data, a subsitute for experiment and observational data,
   and is a substitute for theory where it's not available.
4. Deductive and plausibile reasoning. Example for deductive it is raining right now, so the ground is wet.
   Example for pluasible reasoning is it will start to get hot by 12 PM at the latest, the temperature will become hotter before 12 PM.
5. Logical implication is not the same as physical causation. Example is If A is true, then B becomes more plausible,
   B is true, therefore A becomes more plausible. The temperature at 12 PM isn't the physical cause of the heat at 11:45 AM.
6. Named after George Boole.

18. This quiz was fair overall as I expected is covered the material we went over in class
    and didn't cover material we didn't go over in class. The past quizzes in this course had material
    that was covered in our class as I didn't see anything that wasn't that I recall. I woudl say the lecture and homeork are impleneted
    in the quizzes very well.
