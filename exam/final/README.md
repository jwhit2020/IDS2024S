1. Model validation is when the model is accurately validated a data visulization set. Calibration is when a dataset is unacurrate and needs to be edited or calibrated.  
2. Aesthetics in data visualization are map data values that are quantifiable features of results. A few examples are position, shape, size, color, line width, and line type.
3. The best one is the top one with the colors of red, light red, white, light green, dark green because these colors are warm to cool which us humans categorized them as.
4. a) qualitative color scale. b) Color to represent data values. c) Diverging color scale. d) Color as a tool to highlight.
5. Three pillars of science are experiment, theory, and computational and data sciences.
6. Logical imlication isn't the same as phsycial causation. Just cause we say they in order to rain it has to be cloudy but we have physically seen that it can rain without being cloudy as logic can be deemed false by a physical causation.
7. 1. This seems visually unfit becaus it's getting in the way of the years 1900-2000 to where I can see the temperature for those years. 2. Temperature is is in the decreasing tempratures. 3. Positive correlation. 4. Yes, since the data is categorized by time which is the year.  
8. Bayesian probability theory.  
9. Neyman-Pearson-Wald probability theory.  
10. Bayesian probability theory as data allows the incorporation of expert knowledge in scarce data and degree of belief.  
11. The visulization doesn't show how the density correlates with the age distribution.
12. Everything is represented by integers in computers because most data that is entered in computer are numerical.
13. Programming language B.
14. Fortran.
15. Picture.
16. Picture. A looks to be relative equal to B. The same also holds for -B relative to -A.  
17. Deductive reasoning and Plausible reasoning. Example of deductive is that it's raining outside so it is wet outside. An example of plausible is it will rain by 10 AM at the latest, the sky will become cloudy before 10 am.  
18. It means they are equivalent.  
19. Picture.
20. We cannot represent all real numbers in computers.
21. Value of S = 33. Explanation: Since there are 33 numbers in the summation we divide 99/33 which gives us 3 and since there a 3 spaces between all the numbers, the value of s = 33.
