1. Aesthetics in data visualization refer to the visual properties that make a visualization appealing and effective in
   conveying information. Some common aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization. A few aesthetics that could be appear in 
   data visualtion is position, shape, size, and color.    
2. Those that can represent continuous data and those that cannot.
3. Quantitative and Qualitative data. Example: In data visualization, an example of qualitative data could be the categories of different types of products sold in a store, such as "electronics," "clothing," and "home goods." This type of data is non-numeric and can be represented using categorical variables. An example of quantitative data in data visualization could be the sales revenue of a company over a period of time. This data is numerical and can be represented using quantitative variables, such as plotting the revenue values on a line chart.
4. Numerical.
5. Ordered Data Example: Data set showng the monthly average temperature in a city over several years. Each data point represents the average temperature for a specific month, with the months arranged in chronological order. This ordered data allows for the visualization of seasonal patterns, trends, and fluctuations in temperature over time. Unordered Data Example: Dataset showing favorite genres of movies among a group of individuals. Each data point represents the preference of a person for a particular movie genre, such as action, comedy, romance, or science fiction. The order in which the genres are listed does not carry any particular meaning or sequence.
6. Month: Qualitative/Ordered, Day: Quantitative/Discrete/Ordered, Location: Qualitative/Categorical/Unordered, Station ID: Qualitative/Categorical/Unordered, Temperature: Quantitative/Continuous.
7. Axes representing the same type of quantitative data should be represented with the same units and grid size in a plot. For example, if the x-axis represents time in hours, and the y-axis represents temperature in degrees Celsius, both axes should have consistent units and grid size for accurate visualization and interpretation of the data.
8. We have a dataset with two features: "Age" and "Income". The goal is to visualize the relationship between these two variables.
Initially, we plot the dataset using the original axes, with "Age" on the x-axis and "Income" on the y-axis. However, when we plot the data, we notice that the majority of data points are clustered towards one end of the plot, making it difficult to interpret the relationship between the variables. To address this issue and obtain a better visualization, let's transform the axes. Specifically, we apply a logarithmic transformation to the "Income" variable. By taking the logarithm of the income values, we compress the range of income values, reducing the difference between high-income and low-income data points. This helps to spread out the data points along the y-axis, making it easier to observe the relationship between age and income. After  
transforming the axes, we re-plot the dataset with the logarithmic income values on the y-axis. Now, the data points are more evenly distributed across the plot, allowing us to identify any patterns or trends between age and income more clearly.  
By transforming the axes of the plot, specifically applying a logarithmic transformation to the income variable, we were able to achieve a better visualization of the relationship between age and income in the dataset.
