2. ENIAC stands for Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer.
3. Everything is represented by integers in computers as all are made up of electronic circuits in which only two inetgers are represented which is 0 and 1.  
4. The cache memory.
5. The HHD or the hard disk drive.  
6. The smallest unit of information in computer science is a bit, and that bit is a binary digit.
7. (A) The closest progamming language to machine code is Assembly language. (B) No Assembly language doesn't need interpretation in order to become machine comprehensible.
8. (A) The oldest high level programming language is Fortran. (B). It's six decades old.  
9. (A) Assembly language. (B) Fortran, C, C+ and C++ are their generational programming languages, MATLB, python, and R are fourth generation programming languages.
10. The decades they were created, C in the 1970s, C++ in the 1980s, and MATLB Python in the 1980s.
11. An ancestor programming langue of C is the programming language B.  
12. An ancestor programming langauge of C++ is C.
13. An ancestor programmig language of MATLAB is Fortran. An ancestor programming language for Python is ABC.
14. The CPU Cache.  
15. The smallest memory unit in the memory hierarchy is the cache memory.
16. The access to register memory is much faster compared to RAM in mondern computers. The speed difference is because of teh proximity of registers to the CPU.
17. The access speed of RAM is much faster compared to typical SSDs in mondern computers.  
18. The access speed of RAM is significantly faster than SSD and HDD hard drives.
19. The primary roles are Switching, Amplification, Memory, Logic Gates, & CPU.
20. Only adding more transitiors without considering the power consumption, circuits, software optimization and physical limitations won't gurrantee improved performance. You need to consider all the factors to achieve optimal performance.
21. The three tasks are fetch, decode, and execute.
22. Yes it's possible for a powerful computer with more CPU cycles to be slower than a computer with less CPU cycles. As a computer with more CPU cycles but fewer cores may still be slower than a computer with fewer CPU cycles but more cores.
23. The bottleneck of speed in mondern computers is caused by memory access. The memory bottleneck is cause dby slower memory access speeds is often the primary limitaion in mondern computers.
24. Dennard Scaling is
