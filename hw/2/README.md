3. ENIAC stands for Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer.
4. Everything is represented by integers in computers as all are made up of electronic circuits in which only two inetgers are represented which is 0 and 1.  
5. The cache memory.
6. The HHD or the hard disk drive.  
7. The smallest unit of information in computer science is a bit, and that bit is a binary digit.
8. (A) The closest progamming language to machine code is Assembly language. (B) No Assembly language doesn't need interpretation in order to become machine comprehensible.
9. (A) The oldest high level programming language is Fortran. (B). It's six decades old.  
10. (A) Assembly language. (B) Fortran, C, C+ and C++ are their generational programming languages, MATLB, python, and R are fourth generation programming languages.
11. The decades they were created, C in the 1970s, C++ in the 1980s, and MATLB Python in the 1980s.
12. An ancestor programming langue of C is the programming language B.  
13. An ancestor programming langauge of C++ is C.
14. An ancestor programmig language of MATLAB is Fortran. An ancestor programming language for Python is ABC.
15. The first error is syntax errors and they occur when the code violates the rules of the programming language. An example would be forgeting to close a parenthesis in a function call, the wrong code is print("Hello, World!", correct code is print("Hello World!"). Another error is runtime errors as they are often cause by unexpected conditions that the program cannot handle. An example is dividing a number by zero, num1=10, num2=0, which the result is num1/num2 and the code will raise a zero division error at runtime because dividing by zero is undefined. Logic errors: These errors occur when the program produces incorrect results due to flawed logic or algorithmic mistakes. They are the most difficult to detect and fix because the program runs without any error messages. An example of a logic error is a program that calculates the average of a list of numbers but forgets to divide the sum by the number of elements: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5}total = sum(numbers)average = total # Missing division by len(numbers)The correct code should be:numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]total = sum(numbers)average = total / len(numbers).  
16. It means that it's not properly releasing memory that is has allocated. This can lead to a gradual depletion of available memory, causing the program to slow down or crash, which leads to the depletion of available memory and can cause the program to slow down or crash.
