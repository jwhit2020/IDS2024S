1. Three pillars of science are observation, experimentation, and theory.
2. Three different applications are bioinformatics which involves the use of computational methods to analyze biological data, such as DNA sequences, protein structures, and gene expression data. Financial analysis is to analyze and predict market trends, to manage risk, and to develop trading strategies. Climate modeling uses mathematical models and simulations to study the Earthâ€™s climate system and to predict future climate change. These models incorporate data from various sources, such as satellite observations, weather stations, and ocean buoys, and use complex algorithms to simulate the interactions between the atmosphere, oceans, and land surface.
3. Inductive reasoning and Deductjve reasoning.
Inductive reasoning involves making generalizations based on specific observations or evidence. For example, if a scientist observes that every time they drop a ball, it falls to the ground, they may generalize that all objects fall towards the ground when dropped. This generalization is based on the specific observations made. Deductive reasoning,involves drawing specific conclusions from general principles or premises. For instance, if the general principle is that all mammals have hair, and the premise is that a dog is a mammal, then the specific conclusion would be that the dog has hair. This isfrom the general principle and specific premise.
