1. Three pillars of science are compulation Data, experimentation, and theory.  
2. Three different applications are bioinformatics which involves the use of computational methods to analyze biological data, such as DNA sequences, protein structures, and gene expression data. Financial analysis is to analyze and predict market trends, to manage risk, and to develop trading strategies. Climate modeling uses mathematical models and simulations to study the Earth’s climate system and to predict future climate change. These models incorporate data from various sources, such as satellite observations, weather stations, and ocean buoys, and use complex algorithms to simulate the interactions between the atmosphere, oceans, and land surface.
3. Inductive reasoning and Deductive reasoning.
Inductive reasoning involves making generalizations based on specific observations or evidence. For example, if a scientist observes that every time they drop a ball, it falls to the ground, they may generalize that all objects fall towards the ground when dropped. This generalization is based on the specific observations made. Deductive reasoning,involves drawing specific conclusions from general principles or premises. For instance, if the general principle is that all mammals have hair, and the premise is that a dog is a mammal, then the specific conclusion would be that the dog has hair.  
4. Logical implication refers to the relationship between two statements where the truth of one statement guarantees the truth of another statement. For example,  “If it is raining, then the ground is wet.” This is a logical implication because if it is indeed raining, then the ground will be wet. However, the rain itself doesn't physically cause the ground to become wet. The physical causation is actually the water from the rain coming into contact with the ground and being absorbed.  
5. Since a person is crawling out of a jewerly store through a broken window carrying a bag full of jewelry, then A is true, because their is enough evidence as B is true.  
12.  
a. The smallest unit of information is a bit. b. In a universe devoid of anything else, you would not be able to determine your coordinates or motion without additonal information. 1. 1 box can represent 2 different things. 2. 2 boxes can represent 4 different things. 3. 3 boxes can represent 6 different things.
